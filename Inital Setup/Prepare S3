We will use AWS Cloud9 to run shell commands, edit and run Python scripts for the labs. Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It combines the rich code editing features of an IDE such as code completion, hinting, and step-through debugging, with access to a full Linux server for running and storing code.

Prepare Cloud9 Variables, Local Directories, Files & Workshop Configurations

1. Go to the AWS Cloud9 console in your environment and you should see a Cloud9 with name glueworkshop. Click Open IDE button to enter Cloud9 IDE environment.
2. In Cloud9, click on the menu bar Window and then New Terminal. This will create a new tab and load a command-line terminal. You will use this terminal window throughout the lab to execute the AWS CLI commands and scripts.
3. Copy below commands (always use the tiny copy icon on the top-right-corner of the code block!!!) and paste it in your Cloud9 Command Line Terminal:

```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```
